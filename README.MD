# Installation
You can download complete binaries from the release tab.
## Development build
1. Download the repository
2. `npm install` to install dependecies
3. `npm start` to launch

### Startup Arguments
One can pass a `--headless` argument to start the server in headless mode. This will disable the GUI.
## Packaging
This is more a comment for the future version of me. There is one command for packaging using nexe.
```bash
npx nexe index.js --build --python python3 --resource "./{lang,templates,static}/**/*" --ouput "openCountdown.exe‚Äù
```
Where `--python` is only needed in some envoirments for some reason. Also  adjust `--output` for your target OS.

*Small disclaimer: Please do not use openCountdown for military or life-depending applications. Please also refrain from using openCountdown for launching rockets.*
